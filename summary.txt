Pizza Sales Data Analysis - Summary Report
This project analyzes pizza sales data to understand order trends, revenue generation, and customer preferences. Using SQL, various queries were executed to extract meaningful insights from multiple tables, including orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types.

The analysis covered total orders, revenue, popular pizza types, size preferences, category distribution, and peak ordering times. Additionally, advanced metrics like revenue contribution and cumulative sales trends were examined.

Findings suggest optimizing inventory for high-demand pizzas, leveraging peak hours for promotions, and adjusting pricing strategies for low-selling items. These insights can help enhance sales performance and improve overall business decision-making.
